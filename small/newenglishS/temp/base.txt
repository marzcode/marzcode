Once Upon A Time There Were Four Little Rabbits, And Their Names Were— Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail, And Peter.
They Lived With Their Mother In A Sand-bank, Underneath The Root Of A Very Big Fir Tree.
#now, My Dears,# Said Old Mrs. Rabbit One Morning, #you May Go Into The Fields Or Down The Lane, But Don’t Go Into Mr. Mcgregor’s Garden: Your Father Had An Accident There;
He Was Put In A Pie By Mrs. Mcgregor.#
#now Run Along, And Don’t Get Into Mischief. I Am Going Out.#
