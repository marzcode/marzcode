Ok so in the folder "essental" you will find 3 files.

first the "pickel.py" contains the nessisary code to convert any pickel.txt files into pickel.py.

Next the dict.txt and master needs to be placed into the temp folder of a language inorder to work the encryption process.

The master file is also used for the decyption process but not the dict.txt,
Place the master file into the decode/Decode folder of a specific language.


The idea of the 3 folders,
Large, Medium, Small

Is that I am at the stage where I am trying to configure the algorithm to work smoothly for different text file sizes,
Small would suit text messages,
Large for like books,
and medium for somewhere inbetween.

There is/was a bug with large text files, due to the pickeling, that it would not read the entirety of the pickel, as the master file had 100,000 of lines.
so COnfigureKeys is setiing out to resolve that.

and it has also inspired the process of setting up medium and small.
as large was and is the origianl project that I created.
