Ok so the files in this folder:

the file 1680 is a list of all the permutations used for stage on encoding.

so just shuffel this or whatever.
and I was planning on implementing a way to share this between two parties by finding a way to share it over multiple messages.
For example if we had a list of lets say five different permutations:
"abcd
abce
abcf
abcg
abch"

then in order to share the new 1680 code you would just have to share the list out over multiple messages.
My logic behind this is that the script "newtry.py" (which goes on to exicute "st.py") formates out a list of codes that will cover multiple messages.

So then all I have to do is implement a way to say write

"adce" in my first message
"abcg" in my second
"abch" in my third
"abcd" in my fourth
and "abcf" in my fifth

to let the other partie know that the new code is

"abce
abcg
abch
abcd
abcf"

anyway after shuffeling or rearranging the file 1680,save it as mylsp and just exicute the script "newtry.py" and you will be left with the files "dicts" and "master"

you need these for the main encryption to work
