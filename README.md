### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This repository has been created for tohe possible hosting of an encryption that I rolled myself.
But first I need to figure out what license I want to apply to it.

I would like to be able to make money off this project as I have spent a considerable amount of time on it
but at the same time I need to display it for public scrutenty

so Im in two minds about the whole thing.
